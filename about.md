#### Hi, Iâ€™m Urmil :)
I'm a Computer Science Grad student at [NC State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/). I am also a part-time software developer at [Device Magic Inc](https://www.devicemagic.com/). I have worked on several projects, most of which are open-source. You can find them [here]({{ site.url }}/projects).  
  
Outside of my professional area, I enjoy playing online games such as the [Age of Empires](https://www.voobly.com/games/view/Age-of-Empires-II-The-Conquerors) and [Fortnite](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/home). I'm also a proficient Chess player with an average elo score of 1200 on [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/)
