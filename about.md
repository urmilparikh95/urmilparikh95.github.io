#### Hi, Iâ€™m Urmil :)
I'm a Computer Science Grad student at [NC State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/). I am also a part-time software developer at [Device Magic Inc](https://www.devicemagic.com/).  
I have worked on several projects, most of which are open-source and you can find them [here]({{ site.url }}/projects).  
I like playing online games such as the Age of Empires and Fortnite. I'm also a proficient Chess player.
